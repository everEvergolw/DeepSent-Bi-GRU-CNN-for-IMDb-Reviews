The Python script is creating a sentiment analysis model using a Bi-LSTM-Conv model with Keras on the IMDb movie review dataset. 

To run this script, you would need to have a proper Python environment set up with the necessary packages installed. 

Here's how you can run this script:

Pre-requisites:

Python 

Required Python packages:
tensorflow
pandas
numpy
sklearn
gensim
re

Access to the IMDb dataset file.

Installation:

Install the necessary Python packages (if they're not installed yet) by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install tensorflow pandas numpy sklearn gensim

Running the script:

Save the script to a Python file, for instance sentiment_analysis.py.

Make sure the IMDb dataset is accessible and its path in the script is correct.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing sentiment_analysis.py.

Run the following command to execute the script:


python sentiment_analysis.py

Additional notes:

This script is designed to be run in a Google Colab environment, as indicated by the file path '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/IMDB_Dataset.csv'. 

If you are not using Google Colab, make sure to replace this path with the correct local path to your IMDb dataset.

The script uses a pretrained Word2Vec model for word embeddings, and then trains a deep learning model using a bidirectional LSTM layer followed by a Conv1D layer. 

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer, early stopping, and learning rate reduction. 

Finally, the script evaluates the model's performance on a test set and computes the F1 score.

Please note that running this script may require a significant amount of time and computational resources depending on the size of the dataset and the specifications of your machine.
